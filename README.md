# kaggle
# This is the first project I'm creating to be able to version control for Kaggle data science projects
# I reckon Kaggle has some kind of version control system too including ability to edit and run code, but it is published for everyone to see, so that doesn't look so good. Hence, I will be using github to test, re-test and finalize my code after which I will be uploading to Kaggle to share, receive feedbacks and learn from the Data Science community instead of being a clown.
# Testing merge this time  
# Testing merge by editing local file
